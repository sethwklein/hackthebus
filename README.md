# #hackthebus

No busses were harmed in the making of this code.

This was made for the
[Code for Maine 2016 Transit Hackathon](http://www.civichack.me/2016/).

It runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 hooked up to LED's on a map. It queries the
Portland, Maine city bus data and lights the LED's closest to the buses'
current locations.
